# Ext-Map

This is a sample application that demonstrates how to load a google map using the GMapPanel in ExtJS.  It shows how to 
load markers from a store and create a listener on the marker that can be listened for in the ViewController.

You MUST obtain a free google maps API key from here https://developers.google.com/maps/signup?hl=en

After you get the key update the index.html file with your key.
